# DisplayingInvoiceLinesUsingTemplate


The same invoice lines, as it was in part 4, were displayed after a template is defined.
This defined template and its invoke are specified in comments of Part5-DisplayingInvoiceLinesUsingTemplate.xslt for clarity.
The html output is same with part 4, therefore I didn't put it here.
